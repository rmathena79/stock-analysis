# Module 2 Challenge - Roy Mathena

## Contents
- **HOWTO.mp4**: Video showing how to view and execute the solution code
- **Module2_Challenge_RPM.bas**: Code for solving the challenge
- **Multiple_year_stock_data_RPM.xlsm**: Macro-enabled workbook with code already imported
- ***.PNG**: Screenshots of the results

## Instructions
As demonstrated in the video, the easiest thing to do is open the XLSM file and click the "Run" button in the first worksheet.

Alternately, open your own test workbook, go into the Visual Basic window, and File -> Import the provided .BAS file. Run the PopulateAllSheets() subroutine in the newly imported Module1 module.

## Other Notes
The grading criteria say conditional formatting should be applied to "the percent change column", but the instructions do not mention formatting this column and the provided images do not show any formatting. So my solution does not format this column.
